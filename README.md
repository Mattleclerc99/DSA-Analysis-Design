# DSA-Analysis-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? With project Two, I struggled particularly with the code to read data from the .txt file. Loading data from a file, especially when the format is complex, was tricky. The current implementation uses a combination of the 'ifstream' class for file input and the stringstream class to parse individual lines from the file. This approach allows for reading delimited data (in this case, separated by commas) and then storing it in the appropriate data structure. To help solve this, I drew insights from StackOverflow, notably in grasping the loading technique (as highlighted by the comment in your code). Tapping into online platforms, such as StackOverflow, is a typical strategy for developers, especially when navigating intricate challenges.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. When I tackled project two, I began by dissecting the main tasks: loading, storing, and displaying course data. I quickly realized the need for efficient data handling, leading me to choose maps and vectors. I picked a map for its swift look-up capabilities, especially since I needed to frequently access course details. Meanwhile, I used a vector within the Course struct to cater to the ever-changing nature of course prerequisites.
Understanding the right data structures isn't just about coding; itâ€™s about making sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Through this project, I truly appreciated how foundational knowledge in computer science can elevate even a simple task to something more efficient and responsive.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? When I hit snags in the code, I found it useful to step back and break the problem into smaller parts, tackling each one at a time. This approach, paired with regular testing and debugging, was invaluable. It taught me the importance of perseverance and the iterative nature of problem-solving in programming.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? The project underscored the critical role of data structures in shaping a program's efficiency and responsiveness. By deliberating on the best structures to use, I realized that a thoughtful initial design can save a lot of optimization effort down the line. Another approach being able to turn to outside platforms like StackOverflow when faced with complex challenges highlighted the significance of collaborative learning in software development. It's not about knowing all the answers but about knowing where to find them.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I learned the importance of commenting and documenting code consistently. While the use of StackOverflow helped me understand the file-loading mechanism, it was vital to annotate this in the code for future reference, ensuring that any developer revisiting it can quickly grasp its logic. I also learned that by utilizing maps and vectors, I learned the importance of choosing adaptable data structures. These structures can handle changes, such as additional courses or prerequisites, without requiring significant code overhauls.
